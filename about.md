I'm currently a senior student at Peking University, China. I major in economics and minor in mathematics.

In the near future, I will go to Tsinghua University, also in Beijing, China. Management science will be the main research category of my coming three years.

Sincerely hope that I count get a job on quantitative finance when graduate. : )
